    <h1>The Long Goodnight</h1> <h3><u>Chapter 1: The City and the Silence</u></h3> <p>Detective Hardcastle shuddered when he heard the knock at his door. Midnight on a Saturday, and somebody was looking for a gumshoe? It smelled like trouble, because if he had learned one thing in his time as a private eye, it was that all the city's ghosts came out at night.</p>
