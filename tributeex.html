      <h3>A Brief Timeline of Events in Dr. Feynman's Life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          1935 Graduates Far Rockaway High School earning honors in all his academic subjects. Later that year he

          at MIT with a $100.00 per year scholarship.
        </li>
        <li>
          1939 Received a bachelor's degree, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Also won the Putnam Competition,
          considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics examination in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          1940 Feynman delivers his first seminar. Audience included theoretical physicists Albert Einstein and Wolfgang
          Pauli, and mathematician/physicist John von Neumann.
        </li>
        <li>
          1942 Received a PhD from Princeton University. Feynman's thesis was titled "The Principle of Least Action in
          Quantum Mechanics". Marries Arline Greenbaum.
        </li>
        <li>
          1943 In March Feynman moves to Los Alamos, New Mexico to participate in the Manhattan Project, the development
          of the atomic bomb. Made a group leader in Hans Bethe's theoretical division.
        </li>
        <li>
          1945 July 16 Feynman attends the Trinity bomb test, the first detonation of a nuclear weapon. Late 1945 starts
          teaching theoretical physics for next 5 years at Cornell University. Wife Arline dies.
        </li>
        <li>
          1948 Feynman first introduces Feynman Diagrams, which eventually revolutionized nearly every aspect of
          theoretical physics.
        </li>
        <li>
          1949 Feynman presents his formulation of Quantum electrodynamics (QED) at Oldstone-on-the-Hudson Conference.
        </li>
        <li>
          1950 Feynman accepts an appointment as Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, the California Institute
          of
          Technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          1954 Receives Albert Einstein Award. Elected to National Academy of Science.
        </li>
        <li>
          1959 Feynman is appointed Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech.
        </li>
        <li>
          1960 Marries Gweneth Howarth.
        </li>
        <li>
          1961 Feynman gives up research for two years to teach freshman Physics; the course is preserved in The Feynman
          Lectures on Physics, published in 1965. Feynman later tells a colleague that the Lectures would, ultimately,
          prove his most lasting contribution to Physics.
        </li>
        <li>
          1962 Son Carl Richard is born.
        </li>
        <li>
          1965 Feynman shares the Nobel Prize in Physics, with Shin’ichiro Tomanaga and Julian Schwinger, for his work
          in
          Quantum Electrodynamics.
        </li>
        <li>
          1968 Daughter Michelle Catherine born.
        </li>
        <li>
          1972 Received Oersted Medal for Teaching.
        </li>
        <li>
          1973 Receives Niels Bohr International Gold Medal.
        </li>
        <li>
          1983 Feynman goes to work for Hillis’ Thinking Machine Corporation, a company that intends to build a computer
          using a million processors operating in parallel.
        </li>
        <li>
          1985 Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! published. Also published, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and
          Matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          1986 Following the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger, Feynman joins the Rogers Commission inquiry, and
          after several month's of inquiry uses a glass of ice-water to demonstrate that the shuttle’s rubber O-ring
          gaskets lose resiliency at low temperatures.
