					 					<h2>Review: Night Bikes (2011)</h2>
					 					<img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/coding/nightbikes.png">
					 					<p><i>3 out of 5 stars</i></p>
					 					<p>From acclaimed director <b>Nick Runderdun</b>comes a thrilling tale of suspence and intrigue set on the winding road of the Hollywood hills. Deck (Roban Grunsle) a formal mechanic turned motorcycle thief doing everything he can to pay his grandmother's hospital bills, while Funnyman Dobert Brokus takes a dramatic turn as officer Pete, a cop on the edge who is also a loose cannon only two days from retirement.</p>
					 					<p>This movie will keep you at edge of your seat with:</p>
					 					<ul> 
					 									<li>Motorcycle chases</li> 
					 									<li>Striking visuals</li> 
					 									<li>Minutes-long scenes of Derk staring thoughtfully out of windows</li> 
					 									</ul> 
					 					<p>The tension that the film works so hard to create is undercut, though, by Runderdun's decision to include a laugh track. Even the final showdown between Derk and Officer Pete, during which Derk tearfully explains his grandmother's struggle, is punctuated by uproarious laughter as if from a live audience. If you love motorcycles or thrilling cat-and-mouse games, though, you will hopefully be able to look past it.</p>

          <h2>Review: Egregious Pastel Lodge (2014)</h2>
  <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/coding/pastellodge.png">
  <p><i>5 out of 5 stars</i></p>
  <p>From visionary director <b>Wuntz Krundersen</b> comes a nostalgic and refreshing romp through the magic of childhood set in 1960's New England. Newcomer Sleve Borrison plays Leopold, a 10-year-old chess whiz with a fondness for Earl Gray, and after meeting plucky knitting enthusiast Clementine (Rinchel Draverp), the two embark on an adventure through the countryside in search of the legendary Pastel Lodge.</p>
  <p>This movie will charm any film buff interested in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Memories of youth</li>
    <li>Childhood adventure</li>
    <li>General whimsy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even the film's third-act shift in genre doesn't take away from the appeal. I won't spoil it, but if you're anything like me, you will be both surprised and delighted by the introduction of a certain web-slinging superhero after the Pastel Lodge is revealed to be a portal to other cinematic universes. Some might view it as a cynical marketing ploy, but for me personally, the super-powered finale makes a grand statement about the fleeting nature of youth.</p>
